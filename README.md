# Hi, I'm Robbie

I started learning to code in February 2022. I was 53, hadn't written a line of code since college, and decided Harvard's CS50 was the place to begin. I spent about three and a half months doing every exercise, every lecture, every lab. Then I got so absorbed in the final project that I never actually finished the course.

I've been building things ever since.

Nearly 4,800 contributions since then, which probably just means I make a lot of commits. Thirty-six repositories spanning half a dozen framework phases before landing on Flutter and Dart. The current project is [Zenvestor](https://github.com/pentaxis93/zenvestor), a stock trading platform I'm building with clean architecture and domain-driven design. I'm hoping it's the kind of foundation that won't collapse under me.

Somewhere along the way, I noticed that pair coding with AI is its own kind of coding. Not "the AI codes for me." Genuine collaboration where something emerges that neither of us would build alone. The meta layer is recursive: systems that improve how you build systems. I'm documenting that exploration at [aiandi.dev](https://aiandi.dev).

## What I'm Building

**[Zenvestor](https://github.com/pentaxis93/zenvestor)** — Stock trading platform in Flutter/Dart. Lots of code, most of which works. Clean architecture, domain-driven design, test coverage I'm somewhat proud of.

**[aiandi](https://github.com/pentaxis93/aiandi)** — The blog. What AI-augmented development actually looks like for someone who started from zero.

**[harmonic-depths](https://github.com/pentaxis93/harmonic-depths)** — An explorer for prime harmonic territory. Sounds that Western tuning systems cannot express. A weekend experiment that got out of hand.

**[talos-gtd](https://github.com/pentaxis93/talos-gtd)** — AI-augmented GTD system using TaskWarrior and MCP. Productivity systems are also experiments.
